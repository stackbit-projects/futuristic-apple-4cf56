The holidays should be about spending time with loved ones. However, that’s easier said than done when there are pandemic health concerns or you live hundreds of miles apart. But physical distance doesn’t mean your child can’t play and learn with the ones they love.

Give them a unique holiday memory by enrolling friends and family in an online enrichment class through [**Outschool**.](https://outschool.com/online-classes) It's an easy way for your kids to make memories with their loved ones – whether they’re near or far.![](https://blog.outschool.com/content/images/2021/11/Outschool-Gift-Guide---Give-a-Little-Togetherness---Take-a-Class-Together-Superhero-2.png)Lilia's son & cousins enjoying [Escape Room Superhero Challenge: Save the City by Solving Math Problems](https://outschool.com/classes/escape-room-superhero-challenge-help-save-the-city-by-solving-math-problems-F3dKQ2Ux) taught by [Jordan Anderson](https://outschool.com/teachers/Jordan-Anderson-2020).![](https://blog.outschool.com/content/images/2021/11/Outschool-Gift-Guide---Give-a-Little-Togetherness---Take-a-Class-Together.png)Lilia's son & cousins enjoying [Escape Room Superhero Challenge: Save the City by Solving Math Problems](https://outschool.com/classes/escape-room-superhero-challenge-help-save-the-city-by-solving-math-problems-F3dKQ2Ux) taught by [Jordan Anderson](https://outschool.com/teachers/Jordan-Anderson-2020).![](https://blog.outschool.com/content/images/2021/11/Outschool-Gift-Guide---Give-a-Little-Togetherness-\_-Take-a-Class-Together---Animals.png)Lilia's children and 4 other cousins participated in [A Wild Animal Adventure: The 10 Strongest Animal Bites in the World](https://outschool.com/classes/a-wild-animal-adventure-the-10-strongest-animal-bites-in-the-world-ZfRMdXZu#usUdfCA2fy) taught by [Ashley Felton](https://outschool.com/teachers/Ashley-202009).



Here’s a real example of what taking an Outschool class together looks like and why it’s so special.

### Give Them an Experience to Remember

My colleague, Lilia Ramil, is a Strategic Account Manager here at Outschool. She’s very close with her family and is always looking for fun ways for them to spend time together. So she decided to enroll her kids and their extended family into a few of the same online [Outschool enrichment classes](https://outschool.com/online-classes).

Here’s what she had to say about their experience learning and playing together:

> *“I had an amazing Outschool experience the other day. I enrolled my two kids, my brother’s two kids, and my cousin’s two kids in the SAME set of Outschool classes. It was such a joy! I loved seeing how each of them had fun and interacted with one another and the teacher in the classroom setting.”*

> *“It would be a really meaningful way for families that live far apart to spend time together. We’re all in different parts of Hawaii but still got a kick out of it!”*

Another one of my colleagues Logan Duarte, agreed:

> *“My daughter did her first class this past week with her cousin who lives in Arizona. They loved seeing each other on the screen and having a chance to 'hang out’ in a dance class together!”*

So if the miles, weather, or pandemic are keeping your kids from their cousins and friends, it’s the perfect time to play together online. Kids get to explore a hobby and celebrate the season with the ones they love – wherever they are. It’s a gift they won’t forget – no shipping or wrapping needed.

You can send an [**Outschool Gift Card**](https://outschool.com/giftcard/buy#ustq9P8hxm) or use our [**Give $20, Get $20 Referral**](https://outschool.com/invite#ustq9P8hxm) and start shopping for the perfect [class](https://outschool.com/online-classes) to try together.

### Make It Happen for Your Kid

Every parent and caregiver has someone asking them what to give their kids for the holidays. But getting another toy that clutters up the house and will be forgotten–or broken within a week, gets old.

So, if you’re ready to do something different, ask your friends and family to give your child the gift of trying something new with an Outschool gift card. You can say something like:

> Want to give my kid a gift they won’t forget? Inspire our dreamer by giving them an 
>
> [Outschool gift card](https://outschool.com/giftcard)
>
> . They can choose from thousands of fun interactive online classes on everything from drawing dinosaurs to exploring escape rooms, to Disney-inspired dance and more.
>
> Outschool helps kids try new things and discover their next passion. It’s the perfect last-minute, zero waste, no-ship gift.

Or, if you’re already an Outschool customer, you can have folks contribute to your learner’s [allowance](https://outschool.com/learner-allowances). It’s simple. First, you add funds and choose the schedule settings, then your learner finds classes they’re interested in, and you just review and approve. The funds never expire, and you can withdraw them at any time.

*I hope that this holiday season, the children in your life get to laugh, play, and learn with those they love. May they see for themselves that the real gift is in what we do and share together.*
